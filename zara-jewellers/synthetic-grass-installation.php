                    <p class="text-justify">SYNTHETIC GRASS INSTALLATION can slowly enter the structural areas of your home and cause considerable damage,
                        threatening structural integrity and inviting unhealthy mould and mildew.<br><br>

                        The most common areas requiring reliable waterproofing include bathrooms, laundries and
                        kitchens. However, balconies, garages and basements may also benefit from waterproofing, keeping
                        the dreaded moisture out and keeping your home protected.<br><br>

                        While it may be tempting to hire a cut price contractor, or to head down the DIY route,
                        incorrect waterproofing, whether the result of poor planning, inexperience or shortcuts, is a
                        recipe for disaster. At AM Tiling Services, we bring our 5
                        years of experience to every job, making sure the work is done right the first and only
                        time.<br><br>

                        Whether you need to waterproof your pool, bathroom, laundry or kitchen we have
                        you covered. Our waterproofing contractors are certified in all facets of residential and
                        commercial waterproofing so you can feel safe in knowing that your space is in the hands of
                        qualified professionals.<br><br>
